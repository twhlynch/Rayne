Folder for third party libraries. When adding a library, please add an entry here with the license and any additional steps/modifications required to get the library to work in Rayne! Git submodules are preffered, if you have to make heavy modifications, create a fork in gitlab and add the fork as submodule!  
If possible, please create a static library that gets compiled and linked with the engine for each library. Adding a library makes you the maintainer of it!

## Licensing
When adding libraries, make sure that their license is compatible with the proprietary Rayne license! In general, everything that is licensed under the LGPL, MIT, BSD or Apache license is fine. GPL, Creative Commons or no direct license at all are a NO NO! (If there is no license for a given library, contact the vendor and ask them for clarification).  
If you are unsure about a license and if it is compatible, checkout [tl;dr legal](http://www.tldrlegal.com/)
